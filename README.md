Loan Calculator Web Functionality
Hi there!

This script provides the backend functionality for a loan calculator which users will interact with on a lending site. 
It generates a comprehensive list of information about the loan amount, monthly repayment, and other relevant details. 
This information is aimed at helping users make informed decisions about their preferred loan amount, ensuring it aligns with their financial situation.

Note: This code will be periodically updated to enhance its features and performance. 
We encourage you to run the script multiple times and explore all available options to gain a deeper understanding of its functionality.

Thank you for your interest in our loan calculator web functionality.
